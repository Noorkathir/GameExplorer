Users can browse different games according to their tastes by using the List Page, which shows categories of game genres.

Now this is my favorite part GuessGame ! Users are challenged to match a game description with a suitable title from the number of options on this page, which adds excitement. Under a brief game description, it displays three clickable alternatives on an eye-catching background. Users can experience the excitement of making an accurate guess and test their expertise. On the right side of the screen, there are also two quick-access buttons for going to the scoreboard or home page.

The results page shows whether the user's guess was correct or wrong for the given game description. It provides feedback with a smiley face for correct guesses and a sad face for incorrect guesses. Additionally, it displays the game's title, genre, platform, publisher, and description, offering educational value about the guessed game. Users can navigate back to the game screen to continue playing (take it to a new session and shuffle the past one).

A full summary of player accomplishments can be found on the Scoreboard Page. It provides a simple and straightforward overview of the player's performance by showing their name, unique ID, and current score. Users may easily return to the main menu for additional exploring or gameplay due to the design's goal of accessibility and simplicity.
